# MDIA-1620
**Cool** MDIA 1620 repo moment
***
Name: Samuel Chua
***
## First README log
1. Relearned the version control convention
2. Rediscovered markdown syntax (very cool)
3. Rediscovered 'cd ..' as a command.
***
- So far slightly unfamiliar with more indepth markdown text.
- Not much extra questions to be had. (I've used github before)
***
I'm feeling "Savvy".

***
## Second README log
1. Recognizing this same issue as I previously did in my CST course.
2. Being straightforward with github auth actually being the solution..
3. 'cls' being the clear equivalent to clear on the terminal line.

***
- Still baffled by code configurations. Despite previous experiences.
- Not much more to be confused of. Staying tuned in!

***
I'm feeling "exuberant".
